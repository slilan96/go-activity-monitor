# go-activity-monitor

A small project to create a FOSS alternative to RescueTime and other time tracking apps for linux. There are other FOSS tools out there, but some are very old
and barely maintained, so now is a good time as ever to get hands dirty with this.

Intention is to have this as a CLI tool. Add it as part of your startup application and you can use the CLI to interact with it
